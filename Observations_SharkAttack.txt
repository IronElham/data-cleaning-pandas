Questions/ Problems/ Observations

•	Should we translate the colours from Excel to a column?

•	Last 25 rows are NaNs

•	Column "Case Number" and "Case Number.1" Always the same data? Then 	delete one of them (Case Number has one more value)

•	what is column "Unnamed: 11"? It has a lot of data, seems to be yes/no input

•	time, species and age have a lot of NaN (almost or more than half)

•	Columns "Unnamed:21" and "Unnamed:22" are completely empty? Delete 	both (almost completely empty, how to find the non-null values?)

•	date Format Needs to be synchronized and column "Year" can be deleted if year Always in date or otherwise include year in date and then delete "Year"

•	introduce Country codes


•	categorize activities? Surfing, Diving, Swimming, "other Sports acitivities", Fishing/Spearfishing, Wading, Boat/Kayak, SUP/Body Boarding, "other" (better than this)

•	Shark species? really messy, should we try to categorize this?

•	unprovoked/provoked: weird column

• 	Maybe take out of analysis?: "Questionable incidents - Incidents in which there are insufficient data to determine if the injury was caused by a shark or the person drowned and the body was later scavenged by sharks. In a few cases, despite media reports to the contrary, evidence indicated there was no shark involvement whatsoever. Such incidents are in blue."

Maybe interesting objectives:
- age when attacked
- time: i.e. which month in which area?
- activity during attack
- tendencies: increased attack in certain areas over the years?
- if we clean species: which species are more responsible for attacks? and where?
