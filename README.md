## Introduction:

Business case: We are a travel agency and are specialized on customers who like water sports of all kinds but are aware of the danger of shark attacks.

For this, we need to look at data of shark attacks to find out where people are more or less likely to be (fatally) attacked and what kind of activity attacked people were doing so that we can inform our customers accurately what they should not be doing.

## Hypotheses:

These are our HYPOTHESES, we created them from the first impression of the dataset and also from common assumptions on shark attacks:

- H1: WHERE Geography has influence: It is more likely to be attacked by a Shark in   Australia or in the US than in other countries
- H2: WHO Demographic factors have an influence:
    - H2a Males are more likely to be attacked by a shark
    - H2b Young people (under 35) are more likely to be attacked by a shark
- H3: WHAT Endangering activity: It is more likely to be fatally attacked while surfing than while swimming

## Content:

The Data used can be found on: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/GSAF5.xls
(It is still being updated, we retrieved the data on 21st September 2024.)

Attached you can find a presentation in which our steps in data cleaning and manipulating and our EDA results are explained. Also, you will find the Jupyter Notebook which contains our entire code and the results of our analysis with explanations.
